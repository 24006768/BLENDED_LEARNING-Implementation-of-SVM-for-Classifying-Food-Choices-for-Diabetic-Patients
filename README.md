# Implementation of Support Vector Machine for Classifying Food Choices for Diabetic Patients

## AIM:
To implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify food items and optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook
